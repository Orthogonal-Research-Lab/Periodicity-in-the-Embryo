## Periodicity in the embryo: emergence of order in space, diffusion of order in time.

While the case for the effects of "tempo and mode" [1] have been made for the evolutionary process, a similar relationship between phenotypic change, time, and space may also exist in development. One obvious answer to this question is to examine the expression and sequence variation of genes associated with cell cycle and developmental patterning [2]. However, there is a potentially more compelling top-down explanation. We will use two model organisms to demonstrate how periodicity becomes less synchronized over developmental time and space. In the case of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a comparison of embryogenetic and postembryonic cells (developmental and terminally-differentiated cell birth times acquired from [3]) reveals two general patterns. For the Zebrafish (Danio rerio), comparisons within and between embryogenetic stages based on measurements of cell nuclei in the animal hemisphere [4] reveal patterns at multiple scales.  

Based on these findings, we predict that periodic changes in the frequency of new cells over developmental time represents cell proliferation without functional distinction. Aperiodic changes in cell birth frequency will represent a diversity of specialized sublineages and functionally-specific cell births. To determine whether aperiodicity represents meaningful information or noise, we can use the information isometry technique [5] to visualize the effects of increasing temporal and sublineage variation. This set of analyses will hopefully provide potential macro-level explanations for the coordination of cell division in addition to uncovering potential precursor events and mechanisms related to differentiation.  

Finally, we predict that the emergence and subsequent changes in spatiotemporal periodicity at the cellular level lead to regulatory phase transitions. For example, there is a one-to-one correspondence between cell division and waves of differentiation after the syncytial stage in Drosophila melanogaster [6]. In amphibians there is a decay of synchrony of division [7, 8] that corresponds to differentiation wave activity [9]. Based on data analysis, modeling, and literature review, we anticipate that further investigation could uncover whether, in regulating embryos, mitosis and cell differentiation are correlated. If so, a revival of the quantal mitosis hypothesis of Holtzer [10, 11], in some form, may be warranted.

Considering the cell divisions for the first period of Zebrafish embryogenesis, we conduct an interval analysis for each oscillation of the data. For time points corresponding to the cleavage stage of embryogenesis [12], Tthis yields three interval groups: the greatest number of oscillations occurs at a period of 2-5 minutes, while a smaller number of oscillations occur with periods from 16-19. There is also a longer 22 minute interval between oscillations.
